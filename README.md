# TaskManager

Create a very simple Laravel web application for task management: -Create task (info to save: task name, priority, timestamps) -Edit task -Delete task -Reorder tasks with drag and drop in the browser. Priority should automatically be updated based on this. #1 priority goes at top, #2 next down and so on. -Tasks should be saved to a mysql table.

BONUS POINT: add project functionality to the tasks. User should be able to select a project from a dropdown and only view tasks associated with that project.

You will be graded on how well-written & readable your code is, if it works, and if you did it the Laravel way.

Include any instructions on how to set up & deploy the web application in your Readme.md file in the project directory (delete the default readme).

Zip up the folder with your web application when you are finished and upload it here.


# Set Up

  - Run Composer update
  - Run Npm install
  - create a new database in .env file (name is whatever you like)
  - run migrations
  - project can start with php artisan serve or valet. Should interact with the API calls both ways.
  - Create a new account and you should be able to create a new project and new tasks.

# My thoughts

I created the app using vue.js but spent wayyy too much time in fiddle with it. I could not get the draggable to work change the priority because I haven't used any draggable and wasn't sure how to go about it.
